        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook implements comprehensive **abstractive text summarization** using state-of-the-art transformer models (T5, BART, Pegasus) on the **CNN-DailyMail dataset**. We'll generate concise summaries from long news articles and evaluate performance using ROUGE metrics.\n",

        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "- Understand abstractive vs extractive summarization approaches\n",
        "- Implement multiple transformer models for text summarization\n",
        "- Work with the CNN-DailyMail dataset (300k+ news articles)\n",
        "- Evaluate summarization quality using ROUGE metrics\n",
        "- Compare different pre-trained summarization models\n",
        "- Build an interactive summarization system\n",
