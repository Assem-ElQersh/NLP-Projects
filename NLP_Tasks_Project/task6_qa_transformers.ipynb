        "## Overview\n",
        "This notebook implements a comprehensive Question Answering system using transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT) for span extraction. We'll use the **SQuAD v1.1 dataset** to build and evaluate a QA system that can answer questions from provided context passages.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "- Understand transformer architecture for Question Answering\n",
        "- Implement BERT/DistilBERT for span extraction tasks\n",
        "- Work with SQuAD v1.1 dataset format and structure\n",
        "- Evaluate QA models using Exact Match and F1 scores\n",
        "- Build interactive QA interface for real-world testing\n",
        "- Compare different transformer models for QA performance\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset: SQuAD v1.1\n",
        "- **Source**: Stanford Question Answering Dataset\n",
        "- **Task**: Reading comprehension with span extraction\n",
        "- **Format**: Context paragraphs with questions and answer spans\n",
        "- **Size**: 100,000+ question-answer pairs on 500+ articles\n",
        "- **Evaluation**: Exact Match (EM) and F1 score\n",
        "\n",
        "## Transformer Models\n",
        "- **BERT**: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers\n",
        "- **DistilBERT**: Lighter, faster version of BERT (40% smaller, 97% performance)\n",
        "- **RoBERTa**: Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach\n",
