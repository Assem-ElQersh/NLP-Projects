TASK 8: RESUME SCREENING USING NLP - COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

üìã PROJECT OVERVIEW
================================================================================

Task: Resume Screening Using NLP (Document similarity / Semantic search)
Dataset: Resume vs. Job Description Matching Dataset (10,000 pairs)
Goal: Screen and rank resumes against job descriptions using embeddings and cosine similarity

üéØ IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH
================================================================================

1. DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE:
   - Load CSV with job_description, resume, match_score columns
   - Train/validation/test split (80/10/10)
   - Text preprocessing: basic cleaning, whitespace normalization
   - Skill extraction: substring matching against predefined skill list
   - Feature engineering: TF-IDF vectors + skill overlap count

2. MODEL ARCHITECTURE:
   - TF-IDF Vectorization for both job descriptions and resumes
   - Ridge Regression for continuous score prediction (1-5 scale)
   - Feature combination: job_TF-IDF + resume_TF-IDF + skill_overlap
   - Sublinear TF scaling for better feature weighting

3. EVALUATION METRICS:
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) 
   - R-squared (R¬≤) for regression performance
   - Classification accuracy (rounded scores)

üìä RESULTS & PERFORMANCE
================================================================================

TRAINING RESULTS:
- Validation MAE: 0.563
- Validation RMSE: 0.712
- Test MAE: 0.565
- Test RMSE: 0.722
- Test R¬≤: 0.624

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
‚úÖ Good regression performance with R¬≤ = 0.624
‚úÖ Low MAE (~0.56) indicates accurate score predictions
‚úÖ Model successfully discriminates between well-matched and poorly-matched pairs

EXAMPLE PREDICTIONS:
- Excellent Match (Score: 5.0): Data Scientist JD + ML Engineer Resume
- Poor Match (Score: 2.0): Software Engineer JD + Marketing Specialist Resume
