TASK 7: TEXT SUMMARIZATION USING PRE-TRAINED MODELS - FINAL REPORT
================================================================================
DATASET ANALYSIS:
   • CNN-DailyMail Dataset Successfully Loaded
   • Training Articles: 5000
   • Validation Articles: 1000
   • After Filtering: 4182 train, 850 validation
   • Average Compression Ratio: ~14:1 (article to summary)
MODELS IMPLEMENTED:
   • BART-Large-CNN: Facebook's model fine-tuned on CNN-DailyMail
   • T5-Base: Google's text-to-text transformer
   • Pegasus-CNN-DailyMail: Google's summarization-specific model
   • DistilBART-CNN: Lightweight version of BART for faster inference
EVALUATION METRICS:
   • ROUGE-1: Unigram overlap between generated and reference summaries
   • ROUGE-2: Bigram overlap for measuring fluency
   • ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence for structural similarity
   • Inference Time: Model speed comparison
   • Summary Length: Output consistency analysis
