TASK 7: TEXT SUMMARIZATION USING PRE-TRAINED MODELS - FINAL REPORT
================================================================================

ðŸ“Š DATASET ANALYSIS:
   â€¢ CNN-DailyMail Dataset Successfully Loaded
   â€¢ Training Articles: 5000
   â€¢ Validation Articles: 1000
   â€¢ After Filtering: 4182 train, 850 validation
   â€¢ Average Compression Ratio: ~14:1 (article to summary)

ðŸ¤– MODELS IMPLEMENTED:
   â€¢ BART-Large-CNN: Facebook's model fine-tuned on CNN-DailyMail
   â€¢ T5-Base: Google's text-to-text transformer
   â€¢ Pegasus-CNN-DailyMail: Google's summarization-specific model
   â€¢ DistilBART-CNN: Lightweight version of BART for faster inference

ðŸ“ˆ EVALUATION METRICS:
   â€¢ ROUGE-1: Unigram overlap between generated and reference summaries
   â€¢ ROUGE-2: Bigram overlap for measuring fluency
   â€¢ ROUGE-L: Longest common subsequence for structural similarity
   â€¢ Inference Time: Model speed comparison
   â€¢ Summary Length: Output consistency analysis
