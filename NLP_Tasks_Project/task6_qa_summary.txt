   ‚Ä¢ Comprehensive evaluation using standard SQuAD metrics
   ‚Ä¢ Interactive QA system for real-world testing
   ‚Ä¢ Detailed error analysis and performance insights
   ‚Ä¢ Performance vs speed trade-off analysis
   ‚Ä¢ Question type and answer length analysis

üí° TECHNICAL INSIGHTS:
   ‚Ä¢ Transformer models excel at reading comprehension tasks
   ‚Ä¢ Pre-trained models on SQuAD achieve high accuracy out-of-the-box
   ‚Ä¢ BERT-large generally provides highest accuracy
   ‚Ä¢ DistilBERT offers excellent speed-accuracy trade-off
   ‚Ä¢ Model confidence correlates well with actual performance

üîß IMPLEMENTATION FEATURES:
